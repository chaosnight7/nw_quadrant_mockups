# NW Quadrant Design Mockups

This is a place to store and play different design ideas and concepts for the NW Quadrant class project.  Follow [this link](http://petestreet.github.io/nw_quadrant_mockups/) to browse the design ideas.

### How to contribute

- Let me know what your github username is so I can add you as a collaborator.
- [Clone this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
- Make a new local branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name` (make it a descriptive branch name).
- Make any changes you'd like in this new branch.  Test the changes out by saving your code and accessing your page with a web browser.
- You may edit the pages that are already in the repo, or make a new page (we need designs for the home page, organization page, account/edit organizaion page, full organization list, admin page, et cetera).
- To make your own page, follow the naming convention `pagetype_#` (e.g. my test for the home page is `homepage_1.html`) for each relevant file you add.  Keep these files separate from each other, and put them in their respective folders (html/css/js).  Finally, add a link to the new html page inside `index.html`, as you see in the `homepage_1` example.
- When you're ready, push your local branch to github: `git push origin my-branch-name`.
- Click "new pull request" on the repository page, and make sure you're comparing the new branch with `gh-pages` (I will manually merge with `master` after a pull request is approved).
